Developing a good combinator
============================

A combinator is essentially a label for a query that will combine your data with concepts. The following key components are required for any new combinator. Examples of these can be found in |spreadsheet|.

* **Combinator (mapping) name.** A short human-readable description of the connection to be made
* **Data query.** A database query string that gathers the appropriate data to support the connection.
* **List of connected concepts.** Concepts should be chosen from the list of concepts outlined by the CIDOC CRM. 
* **Reasoning for connection.** A short description of the relevance and reasoning behind the connection. 
* **Literature citations.** List of the supporting literature used to formulate the combinator.
