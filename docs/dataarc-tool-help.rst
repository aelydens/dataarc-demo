What is the purpose of the dataArc search tool?
===============================================
This dataARC search tool is designed to help students and researchers discover and explore diverse interconnected data sources relevant for interdisciplinary studies of long-term human ecodynamics in the North Atlantic. Search results produced through this tool will include data provided by specialists in different domains, information about the connections between these datasets, and background information about the data sources and how they are typically used. The aim of the tool is to encourage users to assess the potential relevance to their research of datasets from outside their own area of expertise. It’s important to understand how datasets are interconnected in the tool to apply filters effectively and interpret your search results correctly.

What kind of data is available through the search tool?
========================================================
The dataArc search tool includes diverse datasets contributed by researchers working in domains from Saga Studies through paleoentomology. Because the data are quite varied, and because these very different types of data have to be analysed and interpreted in different ways, we’ve categorized them into three general types:  archaeological, textual, and environmental.  Throughout the dataARC Search Tool, archaeological sources are always shown in blue, textual in orange, and environmental in green.  This simple color scheme is used throughout to visually categorize the data visualization graphs, filter, and result options. 

How do I run a basic search?  What happens when multiple filters are applied?
=============================================================================

There are four methods for filtering or querying data in dataARC:
        -          Time (temporal filter)
        -          Space (spatial or geographic filter)
        -          Concepts (conceptual filter based on an ontology)
        -          Keyword (traditional keyword search)
        
A user may choose to define one or a combination of filters.  The time, space, and concept filters each feature a graph that provides the user with a quick visual indication of the quantity of data available for different time periods, different locations, and connected to different concepts.  As the user begins to filter the data, the information depicted in each graph changes based on the newly filtered results.  For example, if the user applies a temporal filter of 500-700 CE and gets a 2,500 result subset, then the map and concepts visualizations are updated to only show the data from those 2,500 newly selected records.  The aim is to help researchers identify areas that are data-rich across multiple datasets. Most users will be familiar with where the data-rich areas are for their own domain, but won't know where good sets of complementary data from other domains are available. A detailed guide on how to use each filter is provided in the sections below.

.. note:: 
Helpful Tip:  The filters do not need to be completed in any particular order.  Feel free to start with a concepts filter.  We recommend applying a filter and then revisiting the other data visualization graphs to view the changes that reflect the newly selected data.  The dynamic data visualization graphs are a powerful feature of dataARC.

Temporal Filter: How do I use the timeline graph to create a temporal filter?
=============================================================================
The dataARC timeline provides a visual indication of data availability or richness for different temporal ranges (e.g. millennium, century, and decade).  If you have a specific time period that you are interested in, it is recommended to explore the timeline graph to assess data availability for your defined period.  The data in the timeline are displayed according to the dataARC color scheme (:red:`archaeological`, textual, and environmental) with **darker colors indicating more data and lighter colors indicating less data.**

Assess data availability and create a temporal filter for a period of interest
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  To begin using the timeline graph, select a millennium of interest.  Once a millennium is selected, the graph changes to show the data availability by century.  
Select a century (if applicable).  The graph changes again to show data availability by decade.  Select a decade (if applicable).

2.  To view exact data numbers, hover over each colored square in the graph to view the exact number of data records available in the desired time period.  

.. note:: Note:  If little data is available for the desired time period, consider widening your date range to include more data.  Use the graph to view data richness in neighboring time windows to better inform your decision.

3.  When you are ready to begin entering your filter parameters, it is important to note that the time last selected in the timeline graph will be auto-populated in the Start Date and End Date boxes of the Filter dialog.

4.  Modify the Start and End Dates if necessary to reflect the period of interest.  Make sure all BCE dates are represented with a negative number.

5.  Select Add Temporal Filter. 

Create a Temporal Filter for a predefined time period. 
---------------------------------------------------------

Archaeologists, geologists, climatologists, and literary historians all think about time differently. Predefined time periods are focused on discrete events (e.g. the Indonesian volcano eruption in 1257), rapid events (e.g. the Black Death in Norway from 1347-1350), or larger periods of time (e.g. the Early Medieval Period from 1050-1250) that are commonly referenced in the different disciplines represented in dataARC.  

1.  To see a list of the available predefined time periods,  select the dropdown list under Time Period.

2.  Choose a predefined time period. 

3.  Ensure the start and end dates match the desired predefined time period. Make sure all BCE dates are represented with a negative number.

4.  Select Apply Filter


Evaluate Results (optional)
--------------------------------
1.  Once the filter has been applied, the gray Filter and Results dialogue box on the right of the screen will update to show the new filter and results subsets.

2.  Click on the Matched, Related, or Contextual texts to go to the appropriate result section at the bottom of the screen (and go to the Interpreting Results section in this document) or continue on to another section to add another filter.

.. note:: 
Note: The data displayed in the other visualization graphs (map and concepts) will be updated based on the temporal filter and the new results subset.
