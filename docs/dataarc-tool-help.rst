What is the purpose of the dataArc search tool?
===============================================
This dataARC search tool is designed to help students and researchers discover and explore diverse interconnected data sources relevant for interdisciplinary studies of long-term human ecodynamics in the North Atlantic. Search results produced through this tool will include data provided by specialists in different domains, information about the connections between these datasets, and background information about the data sources and how they are typically used. The aim of the tool is to encourage users to assess the potential relevance to their research of datasets from outside their own area of expertise. It’s important to understand how datasets are interconnected in the tool to apply filters effectively and interpret your search results correctly. 

What kind of data is available through the search tool?
========================================================
The dataArc search tool includes diverse datasets contributed by researchers working in domains from Saga Studies through paleoentomology. Because the data are quite varied, and because these very different types of data have to be analysed and interpreted in different ways, we’ve categorized them into three general types:  archaeological, textual, and environmental.  Throughout the dataARC Search Tool, archaeological sources are always shown in blue, textual in orange, and environmental in green.  This simple color scheme is used throughout to visually categorize the data visualization graphs, filter, and result options. 

How do I run a basic search?  What happens when multiple filters are applied?
=============================================================================
There are four methods for filtering or querying data in dataARC:
        -          Time (temporal filter)
        -          Space (spatial or geographic filter)
        -          Concepts (conceptual filter based on an ontology)
        -          Keyword (traditional keyword search)
        
A user may choose to define one or a combination of filters.  The time, space, and concept filters each feature a graph that provides the user with a quick visual indication of the quantity of data available for different time periods, different locations, and connected to different concepts.  As the user begins to filter the data, the information depicted in each graph changes based on the newly filtered results.  For example, if the user applies a temporal filter of 500-700 CE and gets a 2,500 result subset, then the map and concepts visualizations are updated to only show the data from those 2,500 newly selected records.  The aim is to help researchers identify areas that are data-rich across multiple datasets. Most users will be familiar with where the data-rich areas are for their own domain, but won't know where good sets of complementary data from other domains are available. A detailed guide on how to use each filter is provided in the sections below.
**Helpful Tip:  The filters do not need to be completed in any particular order.  Feel free to start with a concepts filter.  We recommend applying a filter and then revisiting the other data visualization graphs to view the changes that reflect the newly selected data.  The dynamic data visualization graphs are a powerful feature of dataARC.**

Temporal Filter: How do I use the timeline graph to create a temporal filter?
=============================================================================
The dataARC timeline provides a visual indication of data availability or richness for different temporal ranges (e.g. millennium, century, and decade).  If you have a specific time period that you are interested in, it is recommended to explore the dataARC timeline to assess data availability for your defined period.  The data in the timeline are displayed according to the dataARC color scheme (archaeological, textual, and environmental) with **darker colors indicating more data and lighter colors indicating less data.**
