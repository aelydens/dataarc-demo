This guide will serve as the overview and tutorial for getting acquainted with the |DEE|. The Ecosystem Explorer is
designed to help dataset contributors think through mapping their data to the DataArc community's knowledge map of the

DataArc Ecosystem. The Ecosystem Explorer is provided as a Jupyter Notebook, containing tools for exploring the DataArc
Concept Map, which is structured as an |ug_graph|, and data connections to it. The flow chart below can help guide
