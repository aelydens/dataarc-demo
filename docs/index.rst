Accompanying the |DPW| and the |DST|, this guide provides "how-to" information on all things dataARC!  The result of two successful NSF awards (cyberNABO 1.0 and 2.0 - SMA 1439389 and1637076) and a strong international research collaboration, dataARC bridges data from the humanities to the environmental sciences to support the interdisciplinary study of human ecodynamics in the North Atlantic.  Read more about the project background, the research team, and the wide array of datasets available in dataARC on the |DPW|.  Also learn how to use the |DST| in your research!  

Reference the `dataARC Search Tool Help <dataarc-tool-help.html>`__ to learn how to use the temporal, spatial, and conceptual visualization graphs, how to create and combine filters, and how to download and interpret your results.  Finally, interested in adding your data to dataARC?  dataARC is all about open data and collaboration!  Be sure and visit the Learn how to add your data section to learn more!


`DataARC Search Tool Help <dataarc-tool-help.html>`__

The |dst| is the online interface that allows users to query the archaeological, textual, and environmental data in dataARC.  Learn ho to filter data temporally, spatially, conceptually, and by keyword search.  Use `this guide <dataarc-tool-help.html>`__ to better understand how the dynamic data visualization graphs work, how to filter and optimize your results, and also how to download your data.  


Interested in Adding your data?  Learn how...
=============================================

Preparing your data for ingest into dataARC will be a multistep process.  If you haven't already, familiarize yourself with the |DST| and take a thorough glance of the contents of the |DPW| to better understand the project context and how the data are structured.  

Next, you will want to step through each of the sections below which include:

  *  A guide to learn how to map your data to the dataARC concept map
  *  Take your data for a test drive using the Ecosystem explorer
  *  Add your data using Github and create concept mappings usine the |DST|
  
   
1. A Conceptual Guide to Devoloping Good Mappings for your Data

Thinking about how to map your data to the DataArc community's shared concept map can be challenging. Graduate students working with the project team have developed materials to guide PhD students considering contributing their data. These materials, designed to be used in a workshop, are relevant to anyone considering contributing project data to the DataArc Ecosystem.



2. `Learn how to use the dataARC Ecosystem Explorer! <ecosystem_explorer.html>`__
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The |dee| is a virtual sandbox designed to help dataset contributors think through mapping their data to the DataArc community's knowledge map of the
concept of "changing landscapes." It is also designed to help advanced users better understand how data and concepts are connected in the
DataArc Ecosystem. Use `this guide <ecosystem_explorer.html>`__ to walk you through learning the Ecosystem Explorer toolset that is provided as a Jupyter Notebook.

3. Add your data using Github
